            <div class="panel">
            <p>Your cost of shipping depends the type of cargo, your quantity and the destination you want to ship your cargo. If you are planning to ship a full container of cargo (FCL) the rates will be different if its less than a container (LCL). If its is LCL cargo we will consolidate your cargo with other consignee's cargo and the rates will be based on per cubic meter. Please get in touch with us with the details of your cargo for a full quote.

            <p>'All of the items shipped LCL console must be boxed or crated. If you don’t have proper boxes we provide the service of packing and crating at an additional cost.
